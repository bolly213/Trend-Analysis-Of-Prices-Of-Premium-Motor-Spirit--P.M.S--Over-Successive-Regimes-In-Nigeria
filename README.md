### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

  1. Data Loading and inspection.
  2. Handling missing values.
  3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Explorative Data Analysis

This involved answering questions that includes:

- Initial & Ending Pump Price During The Tenure of  Presidents (₦)
- Percentage Increase in Pump Price Under The Tenures
- Changes In Pump Prices Over The Years From 1973 Till Date
- Percentage Difference In Pump Price Vs Annual Inflation Rate Over The Years.
  

### Results And Findings

- Outside the tenure of Presidents Yar'adua (₦75 to ₦65) and Muritala ( remained at ₦0.1 all through), the rate of pump price has continued to increase when one compare the initial rate to the rate at the end of successive tenures from 1973 till date. The % increase of pump price of PMS under the regime of General Abacha went as high as 1733.33% (at ₦0.6 at the inception of the government to ₦11 by 1998 when the government ended). The nation under the present administration of President Tinubu has also experience a huge increase in price of the commodity from around ₦195 to around ₦850 or even more in the present day market. 
- There has been a 350% increase in pump price by NNPCL since the start of current administration in 2023
- The recent increase in fuel prices in Nigeria is largely attributed to the removal of fuel subsidies by the current government. The situation has been exacerbated by the fact that Nigeria still relies heavily on imported fuel.


### Recommendations And Conclusion

In conclusion, the pump price increased by 4900% from 1979 to 1999, annual inflation rate ranged from 5.8% to 57.2%. 
In recent years pump price increased by over 2733.33% from the beginning of the fourth republic in 1999 to 2024, annual inflation rate ranged from 13.24% to 33.4%. 
It was noticed that inflation peaked in most years where the rate of fuel increased. 
As much as the annual inflation rate might also be determined by other factors like currency fluctuations, agroeconomic factors, wages and domestic inputs, import prices etc.

Government must see fuel pump price as a key indicator of annual inflation rate. Reducing pump prices can help reduce inflationary pressures, alleviate citizen's burdens, and stimulate economic growth. There are need to implement policies to stabilize and lower fuel prices, thereby ensuring a more stable and prosperous economy for all.
